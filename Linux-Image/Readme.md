Hello, 

i got a booting version for CB2 with newer kernel and "latest" (25.12.24) Armbian Version.

I dont take care if you use this Image its under your own risk!

First Download CB2 image
Burn Image to SD-Card
Open SD-Card on your Computer goto directory "root" and search for file "not logged in yet"

Open the file and change it to your settings that you need (Wifi/password/User etc.)
Save the file and put the Card in the Printer.

Wait about 2-3 mins to boot, you should see with a programm of your choice that there will be an IP address to where you can connect via SSH.

First you have to log in with root/1234

wait a moment

now comes some informations there will be "account user "biqu" was made" or something like this.

After this you can logout from root and now you have to manually install Klipper via Kiauh.
